Australian Phone Number Validator.

The purpose of this application is to check if the input of the user matches 
the correct format of the Australian Phone Number.

The application is limited to verification of the format only filtering using regex.
If the format is incorrect, the application will display "Not valid" otherwise "Valid"


Limitations:
This will not check real-time phone numbers in Australia. An API request using REST method will be handful to implement the feature.


Future Revisions:
-Landline REGEX validation per state
-HTTP request for API helper to check realtime phone numbers in Australia (GET, POST, DELETE, EDIT).
-Save the search in DB

Optional:
The validation have an optional checking if there is a country code or not. There is an existing commented code that could be used to check
the input in a strongly-typed process.
